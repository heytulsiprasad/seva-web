## Welcome to Seva

Seva is a hospital virtual ticketing platform (made by us) to reduce the offline
overload of standing in long queues. This will save both patients time and hospitals mental overload of handling gigantic number of people together.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Use styled-components wherever styling is needed
- When in need of common components [check mantine library](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) if something already exists, or feel free to create one
- Component that has local styles, create a folder with component name and have two files namely `index.js` and `style.js` inside it.
- Use prettier for code formatting
